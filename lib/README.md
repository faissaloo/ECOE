This folder contains the action libraries used by ECOE, they are slightly 
modified versions of the ones used by LateralGM in that they have had their 
image data removed because ECOE does not use it in order to conserve space. 
In total, the action libraries with image data are 84.63kb, without it they 
drop to 25.8kb, that's a decrease of about 69.5%. 
 
These libraries were all originally made by Robert B Colton (to my knowledge) 
and are licenced under the version 3 of the GPL, as with the rest of ECOE, a 
copy of which can be found in the LICENCE.md file in the root directory of this 
repository.
